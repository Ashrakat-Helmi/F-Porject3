                                                causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in
                                                Wuhan China. The new name of this
                                                disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In

                                                ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was

                                                disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In

                                        <p>This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The
                                            first infections were linked
                                            to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from
                                            person-to-person. It’s important to note
                                            that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are
                                            highly contagious (like
                                            measles), while other viruses are less so.</p>
                                        <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and
                                            sustainably in the community
                                            (“community spread”) in <span>some affected geographic areas.</span>
                                            Community spread means people
                                            have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not
                                            sure how or where they became
                                            infected.</p>

                                            Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19
                                            associated with food. Before
                                            preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with
                                            soap and water for 20 seconds
                                            for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                                            blowing your nose, coughing or
                                            sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>
                                        <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface

                                            on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
                                            but this is not thought to be
                                            the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                                        <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on
                                            surfaces, there is likely very
                                            low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over

                                            of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is

                                            report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use

                                        <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person

                                            Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19
                                            associated with food. Before
                                            preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with
                                            soap and water for 20 seconds
                                            for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                                            blowing your nose, coughing or
                                            sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>
                                        <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface

                                            on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
                                            but this is not thought to be
                                            the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                                        <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on
                                            surfaces, there is likely very
                                            low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over
                                            a period of days or weeks at
